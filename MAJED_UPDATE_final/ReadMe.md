# Introduction to the Real Estate Database

The Real Estate Database contains information about real estate lands in Riyadh for the first Quarter in 2022, including their prices per meter, sizes, names of the neighborhoods, and the total price. The dataset was sourced from the Ministry of Justice.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In order to gain insights and understand the dataset, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various steps and techniques. The following are the steps we followed:

1. **Head**: We started by examining the first few records in the dataset using the `head` function. This allowed us to get a glimpse of the data and understand its structure.

2. **Shape**: We explored the shape of the dataset using the `shape` attribute, which provided us with the number of rows and columns in the dataset. This information helped us understand the overall size of the dataset.

3. **Info**: We used the `info` function to obtain information about the dataset, including the data types of each column, the number of non-null values, and the memory usage. This helped us understand the data types and identify any potential data inconsistencies.

4. **Describe**: By utilizing the `describe` function, we obtained summary statistics for numerical columns in the dataset. This allowed us to gain insights into the distribution, central tendency, and spread of the numerical data.

5. **Missing Values**: We examined the presence of missing values in the dataset by using the `isnull` function and summing the null values. This step helped us identify any missing data and determine the extent of data completeness.

6. **Additional EDA**: Based on the specific needs of the dataset, we conducted additional EDA steps. This could include analyzing correlations, visualizing distributions, exploring categorical variables, and addressing outliers or data inconsistencies.

By following these EDA steps, we were able to gain a comprehensive understanding of the real estate dataset and extract valuable insights that could be used for further analysis and decision-making.
