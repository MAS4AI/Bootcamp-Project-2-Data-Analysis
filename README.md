- Use pandas profiling.
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).
    - Team members.
    - Introduction (problem, objectives)
    - Dataset Overview and Source.
    - Describe the final ten insights.


- **The Final presentation will be on Sunday (10 min for each group).**
- **Due Date: Sat, 27 May, 11:00 pm**
##Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- Dataset file.
- README.md file.
